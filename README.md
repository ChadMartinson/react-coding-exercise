## Setup

To get started, you will need to globally install [rwb](https://github.com/petehunt/rwb). This is a simple global tool to run and serve this application.

`npm install -g git+https://github.com/petehunt/rwb`

Run an npm install.

`npm install`


The application is already setup with some basic files and can be run simply with the start script.

 `npm run start`.

 This will serve the application at `localhost:3000`.

## Version Control
### GitFlow and GithubFlow
We use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) on a daily basis - this allows us to build quality control into our development, QA and deployment process.

We are asking that you use a modified [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - sometimes referred to as a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) - methodology instead of GitFlow. Conceptually, GitFlow and Github flow are similar.

Please fork our repository and use a feature branch workflow while developing your functionality. When you are ready to submit your work make a [pull request against our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## JavaScript
### Standards
We have a work in progress [style guide](https://github.com/davezuko/gstv-javascript-standards) that you can refer to. We don't expect you to strictly adhere to these standards, but they may help provide insight into how our JavaScript is generally structured.

### Unit Testing
Please feel free to create unit tests - we use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
